  bio: "Highly-motivated researcher and music teacher with desire to enlarge and procure significant contributions to the understanding of Music. My work and teaching are informed by postcolonial perspectives that challenge traditional narratives and hierarchies within academia.",
  philosophy: "In recent years, musicology has engaged in ongoing discussions about the globality of music history. The classroom is designed as a space for students to develop their own connections in discovering the role of art in their lives through the analysis of different musical objects. I aim to include in the music classroom a structure that focuses not only on imparting knowledge in a unidirectional manner, but also on enabling students to draw their own conclusions and take part in the active construction of knowledge."
