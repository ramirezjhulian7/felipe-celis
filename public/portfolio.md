## Statement of Teaching Philosophy

In recent years, musicology has engaged in ongoing discussions about the globality of music

history. As a result, the debate concludes that the very notion of “music history,” as general

as it may sound, cannot be regarded as a universal concept. Consequently, academics have

been aiming to expand our curricular horizons with a new proposal, one that effectively

addresses the necessities of a globalized world and the university as a space designed for

knowledge’s universality. The classroom then is designed as a space for students to develop

their own connections in discovering the role of art in their lives through the analysis of

various musical objects. Music History will allow them to engage in academic conversations,

take a position, and argue for it.

My own practice as a cellist, guitarist, and pedagogue is deeply intertwined with said

discussion, in addition to understanding and spreading the conception of music as one of

the most important cultural symbols of humanity. In this sense, my work and teaching are

informed by postcolonial perspectives that challenge traditional narratives and hierarchies

within academia. I aim to deconstruct the power dynamics that have been highly impacting

the academy, as a means to integrate diverse perspectives into the learning process.

For this reason, I aim to include in the music classroom a structure that focuses not only on

imparting knowledge in a unidirectional manner (teacher-student), but also on enabling

students to draw their own conclusions and take their part in the active construction of

knowledge. This is done through strategies that flip the classroom, the pedagogy of kindness,

and discussions, with the purpose of meeting them where they are at. This is conducted

through comparative analysis, reflection, and co-construction of approaches.

My teaching philosophy, then, challenges the extensions of academy, not as a place that

seeks only the elevated and "fine arts," but also as a space that focuses on listening to and

analyzing expressions outside of it. This not only includes music history’s postcolonial

narratives, but also unthinking power dynamics related to questions of race, gender, and

class. For this, I have them complete one of my signature assignments, called Musical

Pathways. In it, students choose one of their favorite artists and research their influences

and origins as far back in time as possible. This way, they quickly realize the international

fluidity of music and begin to acknowledge the web of musical connections.

This is why in my classes I invite the students to make their own connections and actively

participate in the ongoing construction of the field. In other words, a music history class that

goes beyond the acquisition or “mastery” of informative “facts,” and encourages active

learning and co-construction of knowledge. To this end, discussions, evaluations, and

debates are considered the primary methods for developing active learning.


Finally, I believe it is important for students to feel that the development of the course, as

well as their overall academic process, is in their hands. It is designed by them and for them,

and it should effectively respond to their needs. We use debate modalities such as

snowballing, where students are required to speak and build on the argument of the

previous student. In this way, we democratize the learning process so that it is not solely

dictated by the instructor, but instead is guided by the students themselves, connecting and

interacting in an organic conversation. In the future, I will consider making it shorter and with

more interventions, as the conversation could take unexpected directions.

MWF 10 – 10:

Felipe Celis Gil

fecelis@ttu.edu

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to musical traditions representative of a
variety of cultures and to provide insight into how culture and context work in tandem with
music to express ideas, emotions, beliefs, and (of course) sound. You will study music from
East Africa, India, Asia, The Americas, and other musical traditions that reflect cultural
exchanges and traditions.

We begin the semester with learning about the basic building blocks of music, and after that
you will build on that knowledge to examine the role of geography, migration, politics, and
technology in the evolution of music across time and culture. By the end of the semester,
you will be able to identify and discern music representatives of distinctive subcultures of
music and to explain how the human condition is expressed through music.

**Course Objectives:**

By the end of this course, you should have demonstrated your ability to...

1. Identify/Describe different styles of music and the historical, cultural, and
    geographic contexts in which they emerged and developed. Assessments used:
    1,2,3,4,
2. Analyze music by breaking down components such as sound, harmony, melody,
    rhythm, and form. Assessments used: 1,2,3,4,
3. Critically discuss music and its role in the evolution of history and culture (for
    example, what role does music play in revolutions, either political or philosophic?
    Why are some musical genres more successful or privileged than others on a global
    stage?) Assessments used: 2, 4,


4. Critically write about music as a cultural artifact and social force, using analytical
    observation and criticism and reflective commentary. Assessments used: 1, 2,3,4,
5. Create projects that include a curated playlist or program, artist profiles, and liner
    notes that critically examine music in a global context and describe the sounds,
    settings, and significance of tracks included on the playlist. 3,4,

**Description of Assessments**

**1. Daily Work**

Each week, I will post music, videos, and readings that you will listen to, watch, and
complete. Throughout the semester, you will participate in in-class work, including learning
logs, in which you will answer any questions I’ve posed regarding assigned material. We will
work on these during class. Additional instructions will be posted on our Canvas site each
week. Other examples of daily work include discussion, posting or submitting work to online
platforms as directed in class, etc. Links to these platforms and additional instructions will
be provided in class and via Canvas.

**2. Bullet Journal**

Each week, you will complete three entries in your Blue Book Bullet Journal; these will
consist of music analyses and/or reflective res

ponses. These are to be done and turned in via canvas (picture or screen shot for iPad note
taking) each class. It is important to consider that handwriting has been shown to have
positive effects on learning and memory. When we write letters by hand, it leads to higher
levels of electrical activity in our brain. It is up to you to stay up to date on analyses and
reflections. If you miss class or are absent, please consult with me to discuss ways to make
these up. I recommend purchasing four Blue Books for the semester.

_One of the reasons I consider this particular task to be of vital importance is that students,
like all of us, are exposed to vast amounts of information every day. Proposing the class’s
development exclusively with the use of technological devices tends to encourage a
“scrolling” modality that diminishes their critical and analytical thinking. This course has a
multicultural nature, and as such, it requires a significant amount of analysis, the
development of original thought, and effective communication. Numerous studies have
shown that handwriting is a powerful tool for practicing all of the skills mentioned above._

Blue Books will be collected three times over the course of the semester:

· Friday, September 19, 2025

· Friday, October 17, 2025

· Friday, November 14, 2025

It will be required to bring all previously submitted Blue Book Bullet Journals to class on
November 21, 2025.


**3. Project 1- Song Exploder**

For this project, you will create a vlog or podcast in the style of the popular show and podcast
Song Exploder. This assignment is designed to improve your ability to analyze and write
about music. Additional instructions will be provided on Canvas. You will post your project
to our class discussion board and will also submit it via Canvas.

**3. Project 2- Golden Record**

For this project, you will create a “Golden Record” comprised of a curated collection of
music that reflects modern American culture and identity, with a focus on the impact of how
these are shaped by theories of globalization as discussed in class. We will discuss the idea
of a “Golden Record” more in class. Your liner notes should be a minimum of 5 pages in
length, and should demonstrate your ability to analyze music, use musical terminology, and
to communicate about the significance and meaning of music in a global context as well as
the impact of globalization on music and culture. You will post your “Golden Record” to our
course Canvas provide feedback to peers and will also submit via Canvas.

**4. Project 3- Music Festival Press Kit or Globalization Album**

For your final project, you will have the option to develop a press kit for an imagined music
festival celebrating or highlighting aspects of globalization, *OR* create an album with
accompanying liner notes that examines a theme related to music and globalization. In
either case your project will be posted to our online discussion forum and will also be
submitted via Canvas.

**OPTION A:** For those creating a press kit, the organizing theme of your festival or album will
reflect course themes introduced in the second half of the semester. For those choosing to
organize an imagined festival, you will develop a press kit that describes the purpose of the
festival, curate a lineup of artists from around the world and originating primarily outside of
the United States. You will study the music and write about the artists, their music, and why
you chose to highlight these artists. Examples will be posted on Canvas.

**OPTION B:** For those choosing to create a second album, you will create an album that
focuses of music from outside of the United States. This playlist will be accompanied by
liner notes describing your album's theme and the sound, settings, and significance of the
pieces you chose to include. Your liner notes should be 5 pages long and demonstrate your
ability to analyze music, employ descriptive musical terminology, and communicate about
the significance and meaning of music in a global and multicultural context.

**Assignments proposed and pending on revisions: (Perhaps just used as in-class
activities).**

1. **Musical Influences Map**


Think critically about cultural lineage, identity, and global interconnectivity. Trace back the
music that, in your opinion, depicts your identity and speaks directly of the community you
grew up in, and from there, trace back its origin and influences as far back as possible.

_This assignment allows us to examine our habit of listening to music by placing it in a
historical context. It makes us aware of the infinite network of influences behind the artists
we listen to, reminding us that music does not originate from a single source. To truly
understand its historical flow, we must acknowledge the web of influences rather than a
single point of origin. This perspective brings us closer to the concept of globalization._

2. **Performance**

With a couple of colleagues and the instructor’s (guest lecturer) help, try to put together the
basic rhythmic patterns of Cumbia, Merengue, Bolero or Son Cubano. Pick an instrument,
try it by yourself first, and then, try it with your colleagues. The assignment will be conducted
in lightning rounds of 5 to 10 minutes.

_For the portion of the class that focuses on Latin American music, I have decided to offer
students the opportunity to learn percussion patterns from different rhythms such as salsa,
merengue, bachata, and cumbia. What better way to understand music than by becoming
part of it: listening to one another, playing in community, and allowing the auditory stimulus
to pass through the body, letting the instruments shape the way these genres are perceived_.

**Grading:**

Grading in this class is calculated on an earned points system. There are five separate
categories of evaluation in this course. They are as follows:

Assessment Points Possible

Daily Work and Attendance Approximately 100 points available over the whole of the
semester (10 points per daily assignment)

Bullet Journal Entries

These include musical analyses and reflective

entries. Approximately 100 points available over the whole of the semester (10 points per
successful entry/analysis)

Song Exploder Podcast 100

Golden Record Project 100

299 points and below F

Grade Reporting: Grades are posted through Canvas. All work for the semester must be
submitted prior to the last day of class. Late work is not accepted after that point without a
letter from an academic dean.

**Required Reading/Viewing/Listening:**

Assigned readings and musical examples will be available via Canvas.

Each week, you will participate in in-class activities, exercises and assessments. These are
considered daily work.

3. Review of the semester and party!

_This class presents a particular challenge. Within a single semester, we are required both to
present the framework and then to break it. For example, how might I invite my students to
reflect on the role of colonization in the music we listen to? As we know, this is something
we have inherited. We explored this during the first four weeks. At the same time, it is
important to understand that the way of listening to music we have inherited is not global.
Therefore, we spent the remainder of the semester engaging with diverse musical traditions
and cultures from around the world_.

**Catalog Description:**

Students study processes of cultural transmission, exchange, and global communication
through music. It fulfills core Creative Arts, and multicultural requirements.

Description of Lecture

**Description of Lecture**

I aim to include in the music classroom a structure that focuses not only on imparting
knowledge in a unidirectional manner (teacher-student), but also on enabling students to
draw their own conclusions and take their part in the active construction of knowledge. This
is done through strategies that flip the classroom, the pedagogy of kindness, and
discussions, with the purpose of meeting them where they are at. This is conducted through
comparative analysis, reflection, and co-construction of approaches.

**ADA STATEMENT:**

Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet
the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make any
necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Student
Disability Services during the instructor’s office hours. Please note: instructors are not


allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification
from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, please
contact Student Disability Services in Weeks Hall or call 806- 742 - 2405.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT:

Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one’s own class and/or course work, being
individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior.
Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and
responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the
exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build
mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the
highest level of academic achievement, which must be measured. Academic achievement
includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are
a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.
Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.
Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their
educational and professional careers. [Texas Tech University (“University”) Quality
Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010].

**RELIGIOUS HOLY DAY STATEMENT:**

"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are
exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20. A student who intends to
observe a religious holy day should make that intention known in writing to the instructor
prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious
holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for
that day within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who is excused under section
2 may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately
if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

STATEMENT OF ACCOMMODATION FOR PREGNANT STUDENTS

To support the academic success of pregnant and parenting students and students with
pregnancy related conditions, the University offers reasonable modifications based on the
student’s particular needs. Any student who is pregnant or parenting a child up to age 18 or
has conditions related to pregnancy may contact Alex Faris, the Texas Tech University
designated Pregnancy and Parenting Liaison, to discuss support available through the
University. The Liaison can be reached by emailing alfaris@ttu.edu. Should a student
communicate with the instructor that they are pregnant or have a pregnancy related
condition or may need additional resources related to pregnancy or parenting, the instructor
will communicate that student’s information to the Title IX Coordinator, who will work with
the student and others, as needed, to ensure equal access to the University’s education
program or activity.


For more information regarding supportive measures, please contact pregnancy & parenting
liaison Alex Faris (alfaris@ttu.edu | 806.834.3420) or visit Pregnancy & Parenting. You can
also submit a Pregnancy & Parenting Support Form to request assistance.

Use of Artificial Intelligence in Class

There will be times I will require you to work without the use of AI. Other times, you may use
generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (such as ChatGPT) in this class. At all times, your
use of AI tools must be ethical and properly documented and cited. You are responsible for
ensuring the information you submit based on an AI query does not contain misinformation.
Please know I value your authentic voice, and my rubrics reflect this. If I have a question
about the origins of your work, I may ask you to meet with me so that I can better assess
whether learning objectives have been met. Note that writing produced with the help of
Grammarly, ChatGPT, DeepL, etc. tends to have a very particular tone and will likely result
in a request for a meeting.


## First teaching Artifact and reflection ............................................................................1


**Submission example:**



**Reflection:** After covering, discussing and defining the elements of sound on our first two

classes, on Friday, the last class of our first week, an activity was developed based on the

labels “sound, noise and music” and the question: _what is the difference between them?”_

Thus, together we analyzed the soundscape of the game _The Last of US,_ composed and

developed by the Argentinian sound designer Gustavo Santaolalla. These labels (sound,

noise and music) unconsciously applied when listening led us to a deeper discussion about

the aesthetic value judgements of the listening exercise.

The questions were decided mainly with the objective of getting them actively observing

their reactions: _What do you notice about the pitch in these moments? How does the_

_dynamics change the emotional feel of the scene?_ Moreover, the instruction provided

consisted of encouraging them to observe their immediate reaction to the music and write

down a word that describes it.

Finally, I shared my own analysis of the soundscape describing my own reaction to it,

introduced the composer, the resources that he used and the reason of him using Latin

American instruments, thus the question _where does this music take you?_

## Second teaching Artifact and reflection ........................................................................1



(Interactive map and virtual repository of Musical instruments of the world)

**Reflection:** For this time, we explored and discussed a way of approaching unfamiliar

musical traditions and instruments. This, through responding to a handful of questions. How

is the sound produced? How is the instrument viewed by the culture that created it? How is

the performance technique? How are the tone and range? How is the instrument used? This

is the first approach the students have to the discipline of ethnomusicology. Which are the

ones who have devised a series of categories to classify instruments throughout the world,

based on the ways in which they produce sound. This led us to talk about instrument

classification and colonization, as it impacts the way conceive these topics (see Venn

diagram).


## Third teaching artifact and reflection.............................................................................1


**Reflection:** After discussing how music is related to personal identity, we delved into the

relationship between music and national identity. Thus, after defining the concept of

national identity and listening to a handful of examples, we arrived at the complicated

label of “national or nationalist music.” This last point leads us to a discussion of music

that transcends political borders (political vs. cultural borders) and to question music and

its political use. This is one example of a circular discussion, one of the strategies for

flipping the classroom and letting the students lead the class. They must respond to the

question and build up on the previous’ speaker argument.

## Rap and Academia: Mindful Improvisation and Poetic Structure.......................................

Spring 2025 ( _Reflect ive comment s in it alics)_

**Instructor Email Office Hours**

[Felipe Celis Gil] [Fecelis@ttu.edu] [By appointment only]

General information

Description

In this course we delve into the discussion of rap as an auto-theoretical and auto-

ethnographic construction, through mindful writing, reading and freestyle improvisation. I

refer to Rap as a genre that has the scholarly potential to be incorporated into academia.

Moreover, I refer to hip-hop as a cultural movement containing four elements (MCing, DJing,

Breaking, and Graffitiing). In contrast, I describe rap as the musical genre conveying two of

the elements: MCing and DJing.

In this course, we will practice rap for life, not necessarily for academia, which is why we will
use autoethnographic and self-theorizing methods. In that sense, each class will begin with a
meditative writing exercise in which students will write whatever they want, feel, or think,
and share it (if they wish), with the only requirement being that it must rhyme. In other words,
daily meditative rhyming exercises (which will be confidential, rhymes can be approximate, its
content could be fictional, and effort will be prioritized over quality).

_*Sharing aloud is always optional, and written alternatives will be accepted. *_

Objectives and expectations

- Writing and developing the memories of our lives as the main identity factor.
- recognize and create a network of key influences in rap.
- Complete the weekly exercises in lyrical analysis and discussions.
- Analyze and understand rhythmic patterns and rhyming structures.

_*One of the “ulterior” motives of this course is, of course, engaging in different cultural_

_traditions, however recognizing that rap is by nature an African American genre. This will_

_protect rap’s social context and its futurism, students and the discipline itself. *_


**Description of Assesments:**

```
1) Beatmaking
After the introductory modules to the different DAWs (digital audio workstations), and the
introduction to the elements of sound, develop your own beat sets with which you will later
accompany your lyrics.
```
```
Beatmaking is also a contemplative practice, as it references memory and identity. For
example, sampling (when I first heard this song, how old was I?) to memory (what did it
mean to me before and what does it mean now?)
```
```
2) Musical influences map
Think critically about cultural lineage, identity and global interconnectivity. Trace back the
music that, in your opinion, depicts your identity and speaks directly to the community you
grew up in, and from there, trace back its origins and influences as far back as possible.
```
```
In one way or another, this is also a music history course. As such, we must recognize that
our way of listening to music, as well as the musicians we listen to, doesn't come from a
single source as we need to acknowledge a sort of web of influences.
```
```
3) Speak your truth
Hip hop and rap music encompass "speaking your truth." Choose a theme: Identity,
Societal problems, Coexistence, Personal history (a concept, a character, a historical
event). Write 12 to 16 verses. These writings should be the result of the active
channeling of your ideas and feelings.
They will be picked up in:
```
- **February 22**
- **April 3**
- **May 13**

```
4) Beat the Machine
Pretty simple. The assignment is basically to ask an artificial intelligence to write
something about a specific topic, take that text, and then, in groups, try to make it
better, more powerful, and more human.
```
```
Artificial intelligence is not going anywhere. The challenge that students are facing
nowadays relies on them being better than it. In the present days, AI is the basic
standard, and I trust my students will try to be better than it, much more human.
```
**Required Reading/Viewing/Listening:** Assigned readings and musical examples will be
available via Canvas. Each week, you will participate in in-class activities, exercises, and
assessments. These are considered daily work.

_Rap has been one of the most popular genres of our time, and at the same time, one of the
newest, with only fifty years of history. However, its incorporation into academia has been
interrupted for several reasons, including the power structures that dominate university
spaces and the lack of a methodology that encourages writing not only about the sublime, the
beautiful, and the transcendent, but also about making art from the everyday experience,
perhaps ugly and difficult to express._

_Writing organically and without aesthetic judgements meets the students where they are at.
This exercise, moreover, constitutes a mindful experience in which we observe our thoughts
and emotions and push ourselves to capture them on paper. This constitutes a deeply
liberating activity. That is the goal of this course, a mindful listening and writing that can
serve as an autoethnographic principle from which we can construct a new version of ourselves,
one meant to be conscious and continuous._

_Lastly, all of this will be made possible through the autoethnographic, historical, and
musicological analysis of rap’s historical role as a countercultural genre, the later formation
of the “hip-hop nation,” and the work of poets/rappers, a task we will attempt to understand
and develop._
